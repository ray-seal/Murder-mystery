# Case Files — Murder Mystery (Static Web App / PWA)

This repo contains a small randomized murder-mystery game. The app is PWA-ready (manifest + service worker) and can be installed as "Case Files".

Deployment steps:
- Deploy as a static site (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages).
- For PWA install support, ensure icon.svg and manifest.webmanifest are served from the site root.
